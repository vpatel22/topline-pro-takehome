### Things I would change with more time

This web app is very raw and only covers the barebone requirements asked of us in the takehome description. Though this list is not all encompassing, here are a few things I would definitely change with more time:

1. Add pagination so that we can see all of the images, not just the top 20
2. Move API key into a more secure location (I commented on this in the code)
3. Add a lot of styling to make everything look a lot nicer
   - Card components for each image after a search
   - Better formatting for the user details and image tags on the image details page
